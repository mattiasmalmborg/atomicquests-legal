    <p>If informal resolution fails, any dispute shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Sweden, except where mandatory consumer protection law in your country of residence requires otherwise.</p>

    <h2>18. Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under applicable law, that provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, or severed if modification is not possible, without affecting the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>
