      <p>AtomicQuests uses neurotransmitter names (dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, endorphin, cortisol, testosterone) as <strong>creative gamification themes</strong> only. The app does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, and does not claim to affect actual neurochemical levels. It is not a substitute for professional medical care.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>AtomicQuests is developed and operated by <strong>Malmborg</strong> (GitHub: mattiasmalmborg), a Swedish independent developer ("we", "us", "our").

    <h2>2. Age Restriction</h2>
    <p>AtomicQuests is intended for users <strong>aged 16 and older</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 16. If you believe a person under 16 has provided us with personal data, please contact us immediately at <a href="https://github.com/mattiasmalmborg/atomicquests-legal/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Issues</a> and we will delete that data promptly.</p>
    <p>Users must confirm their date of birth during account creation. If the provided date indicates the user is under 16, access is blocked and no data is retained.</p>

    <h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>

    <h2>5. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom, we process your personal data under the following legal bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contract performance (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR):</strong> Processing your email, user ID, and usage data is necessary to provide the App and fulfill our agreement with you.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR):</strong> We have a legitimate interest in maintaining service security, preventing abuse, and improving our service. We balance these interests against your privacy rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR):</strong> We may process data where required by applicable law.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR):</strong> Where we rely on consent (e.g., optional communications), you may withdraw consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of prior processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Third Parties and Data Processors</h2>
    <p><strong>Supabase</strong> (<a href="https://supabase.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supabase.com</a>) is our sole third-party data processor.

    <ul>
      <li>Supabase Privacy Policy: <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supabase.com/privacy</a></li>

      <li>Authentication tokens are stored in <strong>device secure storage</strong> (expo-secure-store), not in plain text or unencrypted storage.</li>
      <li>Local app data (quests, stats cached on-device) is stored in an on-device SQLite database.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>No method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we use industry-standard safeguards, we cannot guarantee absolute security. If a data breach occurs involving personal information, we will notify affected users in accordance with applicable law (within 72 hours to supervisory authorities under GDPR; within 60 days to affected individuals under the FTC Health Breach Notification Rule where applicable).</p>
